/* Contraband — Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Mark Twain, 1884/1885).  PUBLIC DOMAIN.
   Translations live in lang/*.js on window.__ROOM_LANGS__.

   Editorial rules: the novel is public domain, but this room does NOT reproduce
   its text and invents no quotations; it paraphrases throughout. The original
   novel repeatedly uses a racial slur and depicts racist attitudes as part of its
   anti-racist satire; this room reproduces NONE of that language and treats
   slavery, race, and Huck's moral awakening with care and historical context.
   Standards are good-faith Common Core alignment; TEKS/ELPS flagged "Needs
   review." Relic artifacts are clearly labeled instructional reconstructions.
   Correct answer is index 0 in every choices/options array; the engine shuffles. */

To escape his violent father, he fakes his own death and lights out on his own — and on a river island he finds Jim, an enslaved man running for his freedom. Together they push a raft down the Mississippi, and out on the water they are free and equal. But every time they touch the shore, they run into the greed, cruelty, and hypocrisy of 'respectable' society — until Huck must decide, once and for all, whether to betray his friend or defy everything he's been taught.",
