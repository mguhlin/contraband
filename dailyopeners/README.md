# Contraband Daily Opener a Day · October 2026

A static, privacy-first digital flipbook with **31 daily Contraband openers**. Each date features one Contraband title and two differentiated versions of the same opener:

- **Grades 6–8**: notice, predict, connect, discuss, and short-write moves
- **Grades 9–12**: analysis, evidence, counterpoint, context, and thesis moves

The featured books come from the existing Contraband **Grades 6–8 catalog**. That keeps each daily title appropriate for the younger band while allowing the same title to be used with more demanding high-school prompts.

## Install in the Contraband repository

1. Copy this entire folder into the root of the `mguhlin/contraband` repository.
2. Keep the folder name as `dailyopeners`.
3. The final URL will be:

   `https://mguhlin.github.io/contraband/dailyopeners/`

4. The month calendar is the landing page; each date opens `flipbook.html#<day>`.

5. Optionally add this link to the Contraband top navigation:

```html
<a href="dailyopeners/">Daily Openers</a>
```

The site reuses the existing Contraband hero images at `../images/[title-id]/hero.webp` and title rooms at `../[title-id]/`. It does not duplicate the image library.

## Preview locally

Open `index.html` for the month calendar, or `flipbook.html` for a single day. When opened with `file://`, the site automatically points image and book-room links to the public Contraband site.
